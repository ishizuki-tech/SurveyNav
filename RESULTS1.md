║ Question       : When in the season is drought most devastating for your crop? What is the most  
║                  difficult drought moment? (e.g., pre-tassel, tasseling/silking, grain fill,  
║                  pre-harvest.)  
║ Answer         : Drought during tasseling/silking (July-August) is worst because pollination  
║                  fails, resulting in yield losses of up to 50% or more.
