║ Question: Do you have any irrigation during establishment?  
║ Answer: We rely on the rains for maize establishment in March/April, but drought last year meant

║ Original Question: Would you trial an earlier variety on a small plot next season?  
║ Generated Answer : Yes, I would definitely trial a maize variety maturing in around 90 days on a  
║                    0.5 acre plot next season to see if it improves yields during the shorter  
║                    rainy season.
