Original Question : How much yield do you lose because of fall armyworm? Please think back over the last 3 seasons. (Percent or bags per acre are fine.)
Generated Answer  : Fall armyworm decimated my maize yields over the last three seasons, reducing harvests by an average of 25 bags per acre, especially during the rainy months of March and April.

Original Question : If you could harvest 10 days earlier, how much yield would you be willing to give up? (Percent or bags per acre.)
Generated Answer  : Harvesting 10 days earlier means I'd accept a yield reduction of about 10-15 bags per acre, prioritizing timely planting for the next rainy season.
